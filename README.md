GIMP Plugins
============

These are my GIMP plugins.

Usage
-----

Clone this repo wherever you like, and then copy the `.py` files into your installation's plugins folder. Where that is depends on your version of GIMP and operating system, so please see other GIMP documentation to find your plugins folder. You may need to close and re-open GIMP so that it can find new plugins after you add them.
